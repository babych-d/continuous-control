## Continuous control project

This repository provides way to train Deep Reinforcement 
Learning agent in order to reach the target are with jointed arm 
in virtual environment.

In order to run this code, you'll need Unity Environment that 
Udacity team provided in Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree. 

### Training 

For training, see file `train_agent.py`

### Running

I committed one trained file in model/ folder that you can use 
to run this code without training. Just run:
```
python run_agent.py
```
